The scene of LA's most daring graffiti ""crimes"", billboards have always been the most coveted of Street Art canvases. Daniel found an audience with a large Media Group that owned many of these billboards and arranged for some of todays most respected Artists to create massive original pieces that would be shown on prominent billboards throughout the city. There was only one problem: Corporate America loves to buy their way into youth culture, but it doesn't make it's money promoting independent thought or rebellion. Independent thought and rebellion, however, is the lifeblood of Street Art. Rife with Anti-Establishment themes and Incendiary messages, these masterpieces encouraged everything that defies a system that allows any company to control the skies we look up to every day - and when it came time to put their billboards where mouths were, the Group's decision makers got cold feet and the offer was taken off the table. Daniel was left with broken promises and kaleidoscopic masterpieces the size of three city buses. He vowed to keep his promises to the artists and get their work displayed.

Chapo, the little hunchback, sees him and lingers by the artist. Pedestrians come and go and push him aside, but the boy is oblivious to everything but the painter and his magic. The art of the painter arouses a great latent gift in the hunchback. He so strongly covets artist's materials in the store of a curio dealer that he tries to steal them and is caught. A kind padre, himself an artist, rescues him from the irate dealer and teaches him to draw and paint. One day in the mission garden he sees lovely Eleanor, who becomes the idol of his dreams, the inspiration of his brush. She has, unfortunately, given herself to the profligate, Arguello, who abandons her. Chapo takes her to his own poor quarters and cares for her. Two years later she dies, and the hunchback, still rising in the world of art, adopts the two-year-old daughter. The scene advances twenty years. Chapo, the once neglected and despised, is a giant in the world of Parisian art and the adopted daughter has grown to be a beautiful young woman. They return to the old home, and there is Arguello, living a cumberer of the ground in his old age of vice, cards and liquor. He still has eyes and be leers upon the fair young flower leaning on the arm of Chapo. The indignant old padre calls on Arguello exclaiming, ""she is your child."" The shock and shame finally overcome him and he dies on the spot"
